# CLogicSim
A pure C-based digital logic simulator with D Flip-Flop support and Verilog-to-circuit translation.
# CLogicSim

🧠 **CLogicSim** is a pure C-based digital logic simulator designed for learning, testing, and building combinational and sequential logic circuits. It supports common gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR), D flip-flops, and translates a subset of Verilog to a circuit format it can simulate.
